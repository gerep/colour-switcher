# Colour Switcher

2D. Will run on browser and mobile.

The player is a bar at the bottom of the screen.

Blobs start to fall with a Y velocity. They are spawned on X and fall on straight line. Some will fall in the direction of the player, some will cross the screen. There must be an interval between each spawn to avoid two blobs falling together with different colours.

The player will press the mouse left button to cycle through 4 colours.

The player's colour must match the blob colour that touched it. If not, game over.

Each match gets 1 point.

Endless game.
